Reaching Definitions:

1. For a given instruction, get the predecessors' input set
2. For each predecessor in the set, get the OUT set
    a. The OUT set can be retrieved from outMap
3. Union all of the OUT sets together, and that is the IN set
4. Compute OUT set by doing union of IN and GEN
    a. GEN can be computed by calling isDef(I)
5. Repeat this whole process while either IN or OUT is Modified
6. If eihter become Unmodified, return/break
